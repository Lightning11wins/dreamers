[16:23:47]: Dreamers said "The tiny chef creature, whose name tag read "Waffle Wizzy," began arranging the waffles on a miniature serving platter, as the Waffle Wizard watched with glee. With a flick of its spatula, Wizzle conjured a fluffy whipped cream that resembled a wispy beard, which it proudly wore while presenting the waffle creations to their creator."
